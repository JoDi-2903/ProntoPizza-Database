<h2>Requirements analysis</h2>

several employees with different areas of responsibility. In addition to some cooks
suppliers are also employed. There are always 3 suppliers assigned to each shift, each of which

can substitute for each other in case of illness.
Orders placed by customers consist of a single item or several items.
